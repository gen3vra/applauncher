# App Launcher
Why would I want this? 

In my case, I needed a program to launch Windows 10 apps like Groove music. This program goes with 
https://github.com/gen3vra/steamlauncher
And
https://github.com/gen3vra/customnativetile

# How do I use this?
Simply download the release, paste the exact link of the program you want to launch (in my case I created a shortcut of Groove music, and launch that shortcut with this app).
